        		<h1>About me</h1>
				<p>My name is Carlos Andres Mestre.  I am a 1st generation Cuban-American from Miami, Florida.  
					I have a strong core of family and friends that are very important to me.  
					Recently, in December 2016, I graduated from Florida International University with a B.A.
					in Computer Science.  Working with computers has always been a strong passion of mine.  Like many 90s
					kids I started off with video games, and developed that love of technology into putting together my 
					own PC.  Building upon the hardware experience, I started becoming interested in the software aspect. 
					On my resume, you may see that I also have a B.A. in Business Administration.  These two 
					degrees give me a strong foundations for doing what I love; working as a programmer in a fast-paced environment that 
					promotes teamwork.</p>
			<h1>Hobbies</h1>
				<p>Sports are a significant part of my life.  I grew up golfing with my father at a very early age.  I enjoy 
					going out and playing a round with friends and family on the weekends.  Being from Miami, I am heavily interested in the local teams (Dolphins, Heat, Hurricanes, 
					and when Loria sells, the Marlins).					Television:  here is a list I have compiled for my favorite TV shows.<br></p>
