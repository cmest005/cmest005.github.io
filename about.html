        		<h1>About me</h1>
				<p>My name is Carlos Andres Mestre.  I am a 1st generation Cuban-American from Miami, Florida.  
					I have a strong core of family and friends that are very important to me.  
					Recently, in December 2016, I graduated from Florida International University with a B.A.
					in Computer Science.  Working with computers has always been a strong passion of mine.  Prior to earning my 
					degree in Computer Science, I graduated from University of North Florida with a Bachelors in Business Administration.  These two 
					degrees give me a strong foundations for doing what I love, working as a programmer in a fast-paced environment that 
					endorses teamwork.
				</p><br>
				<p>
					I learned a lot while attending business school in North Florida.  They had a couple of really interesting methods of structuring the 
					classes.  Every teacher I had was a current, or former business professional with lots of experience.  Many of them were past CEOs, CFOs, etc.  
					One thing that worried me for a little while, but I became a lot more comfortable with experience, was that every business class 
					required team projects and presentation.  It really showed how to work in a team effectively.  Once I graduated, I did some temp jobs for a 
					little while.  I realized I just wasn't passionate enough for what I was doing.  That's when I spoke to some of my friends and family 
					and they really pushed me to go for a CS degree.  
				</p><br>
				<p>
					Admittedly, I started my CS degree with little to no experience with programming.  I took a class in high school long before, and 
					dabbled in some HTML, but what I was hit with was a shock.  I truly struggled early on.  I had to retake a few classes and contemplated maybe 
					I had made a mistake.  Again, my family and friends came with their support and I pushed on.  It was a great decision.  After a while it just 
					start making sense.  My grades starting going up a lot and eventually I felt very comfortable in my classes.  A lot of credit also needs to go 
					to the professors at FIU.  They trully would go out of their way to help me outside of class.  They just wanted to see the passion to work.  So with 
					these tools in hand, I feel I am ready for a successful career in something I enjoy doing.  
				</p><br>
					
			<h2>Hobbies</h2>
			<h4>Sports</h4>
				<p>Sports are a significant part of my life.  I grew up golfing with my father at a very early age.  I enjoy 
					going out and playing a round with friends and family on the weekends.  Being from Miami, I am heavily interested in the local teams (Dolphins, Heat, Hurricanes, 
					and when Loria sells, the Marlins).<br>
