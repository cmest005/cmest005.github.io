  <h1>Maxing your dps</h1>
  <h3>Simcraft w/ Pawn</h3>
  Just wanted to give a step by step guide with some information that might help those who want to try to get more out of their characters.  
  This is very simple.  You will only need 2 addons.<br><br>
  Step 1: For those that may not use it, download Curse.  It will make your life 100x easier by automatically taking care of your addons.<br><br>
  Step 2: Download, install, and enable the addons Pawn and Simulationcraft.<br><br>
  Step 3: Log into your character.  Make sure you have the gear equipped that you use in Raid, M+, whatever.  Make sure your correct talents are
  enabled.<br><br>
  Step 4: In your chat type /simc.  It will pop up a window with all your information.  Hit Ctrl + C.<br><br>  
  Step 5: Go to <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.  Click STAT WEIGHTS.  In B) Paste/Ctrl+V your simc information.  Click button GENERATE STAT WEIGHTS.<br><br>
  Step 6: When it finishes you will see your stats.  Theres a box called Pawn String.  Again, copy/Ctrl+C the text in that field.<br><br>  
  Step 7: Go back in game.  Open your character screen and click the Pawn button, or type /pawn.  Bottom tab, click Scale.  In Share your scales 
  click Import.  Paste the Pawn string you got from raidbots into that field.  Hit Okay.<br><br>
  You are done.  Your Pawn now will use the correct stat weights to the gear you have equipped.  Now when you look at gear in your bag you will see 
  a +% for upgrades to your dps set.<br><br>
  <h3>Misc information</h3>
  The reason why the numbers are different than the default Pawn values is because Simulationcraft is taking into account your loaded talents and current gear.  
  This along with raidbots doing its 10,000 simulations with the "optimal" dps rotation will give you the best possible stat weights.  The default 
  statweights do not take this into consideration.<br><br>
  You are also able in Raidbots to view the html output from link in the box Simulation Details.  That information is very interesting, but can be overwhelminmg.
		If you have the time, take a look.  This website does what the Simulationcraft program 
  does for you.  This way is much easier AND FASTER to do.  The program Simulationcraft downloads from the Armory.  Most know that its a POS that doesnt update 
		often.  This is immediate to what you are wearing in game.<br><br>
  Remember, whenever you change gear around, its going to change your stats around.  You will need to redo these steps.  Once you get the hang of it, it will 
		take no time outside of the queue at Raidbots.<br><br>  
  You can edit the raidbot to do more than 1 style of fight, which in turn will generate different statweights.  On the page where you pasted your 
  /simc, click Advanced Options.  By default the "best" Fight Style is Patchwerk, but feel free to mess with it.  For example, you may have an AOE talent 
  and gear set for certain fights.  This will let you find the best possible combination for whatever your heart desires.<br><br>
  "But what about Trinkets???"---Ok, thats an entirely new converation which can be very complicated.  For that I think the easiest way is the actual 
		Simulationcraft program.  You can google the information and see guides on Youtube.  <br><br>
		<h3>A parting message</h3>	
  There isnt an exact science to what you should do in game.  I had been meaning to put a quick page up like this to try to help those interested.  
		There is no fully correct way to put together your gear for your needs.  For example, at one point it showed a DPS ring of mine 
		that was 50 ilvls lower as an upgrade in dps because of my stat weights being so far off.  So I had the choice, drop the 50 ilvls, 
		make it tougher to get into M+ groups and drop tons of Stam for raid, or just stick it out.  I stuck it out because I knew it was only a matter 
		of time before I got a higher ilvl one that would boost my dps while not risking survivability.  That extra stamina makes a huge difference in higher key M+s.  
		Big difference between 2.4m HP and 2.9m HP.   I believe with these tools, along with Discord, anyone can up their game. So Good luck!!<br><br>

<h2>GUIDE TO DISCORD</h2>
Discord may be the single best place for class information that I have found.  There are communities for each WoW class.  They are filled 
		with top raiders who have written guides and put out tons of valuable information on every spec/role.  Here is the link to my guide on 
		getting started with it.<br>
