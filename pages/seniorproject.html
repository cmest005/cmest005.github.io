        		<h1>Senior Project</h1>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			Our project was to start version 1.0 of a results section for the DCU (Drinker's Checkup) website.  
			The DCU is a virtual health counselor, which interacts with a user who may want to learn more 
			about their alcohol issues and seek help for them.  The results of the diagnoses from the questionnaire
			pre-project were just a text-based output.  My partner and I were in charge of developing an interactive 
			results section that engaged the user with the website in learning about their results.  Our pages would use
			HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design tables and graphs to display results.  <br>
			
			<h3>Screenshots</h3>
			<h4>This is an interactive JavaScript textbox which based on the user's input, generates a certain response based
				on said input.</h4>
