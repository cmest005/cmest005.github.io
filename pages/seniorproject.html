        		<h1>Senior Project</h1>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			Our project was to start version 1.0 of a results section for the DCU (Drinker's Checkup) website.  
			The DCU is a virtual health counselor, which interacts with a user who may want to learn more 
			about their alcohol issues and seek help for them.  The results of the diagnoses from the questionnaire
			pre-project were just a text-based output.  My partner and I were in charge of developing an interactive 
			results section that engaged the user with the website in learning about their results.  Our pages would use
			HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design tables and graphs to display results.<br>
			This was a very interesting final project.  The system is set up using 2 main systems to upload and control content
			to the site: Survey Editor, State Machine.  The Survey Editor is where all the content is created and uploaded.  This 
			includes buttons, html pages, and tranactions with the counselor based on user input.  Once the content is created, the 
			State Macine is set up to display the content in an order determined by the end-user's input.<br>

			<h4>This is an interactive JavaScript table where the user enters their average drinks in a certain amount of hours.
				Using an algorithm provided by the product owner, we were able to generate a table which highlights the calculated
				BAC.</h4>

			<h4>This table displays the user's risk score based on certain factors answered in the questionnaire.  The responses are 
				color coded and values based on an algorithm defined by the product owner.. </h4>

			<h4>This table displays an Angular graph based on an algorithm generating a score for the user on the DCU questionnaire.  The 
			original text-based result page only had the numbered results with no explanation.  Our team researched the context behind
			those assessments titles and what their scores might mean. </h4>

			<h3>Code (click to enlarge)</h3>
			I am only able to upload partial code per request of my product owner.  The project is ongoing and privatized.  The code you
			see here is part of our html code on how I implemented a few of the functions shown above.
