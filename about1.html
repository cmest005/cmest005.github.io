        		<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>My name is Carlos Andres Mestre.  I am a 1st generation Cuban-American from Miami, Florida.  
					I have a strong core of family and friends that are very important to me.  
					Recently, in December 2016, I graduated from Florida International University with a B.A.
					in Computer Science.  Working with computers has always been a strong passion of mine.  Prior to earning my 
					degree in Computer Science, I graduated from University of North Florida with a Bachelors in Business Administration.  These two 
					degrees give me a strong foundations for doing what I love, working as a programmer in a fast-paced environment that 
					promotes teamwork.
